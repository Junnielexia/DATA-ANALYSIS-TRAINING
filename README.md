# MySQL

## MySQL Workbench for Data Analysts

### Database Connection
1. Launch MySQL Workbench and establish a connection to your MySQL database by clicking on "Database" and selecting "Connect to Database."

### SQL Syntax and Execution
1. Querying Data: Use the SQL `SELECT` statement to retrieve data from tables.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

2. Filtering Results: Utilize the `WHERE` clause to filter query results based on specific conditions.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
```

3. Sorting Data: Apply the `ORDER BY` clause to sort query results in ascending or descending order.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 ASC;
```

4. Aggregating Data: Aggregate data using functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(column1), AVG(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column3;
```

5. Joining Tables: Combine data from multiple tables using different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`).
```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2;
```

### Data Manipulation
1. Inserting Data: Use the `INSERT INTO` statement to add new records to a table.
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);
```

2. Updating Data: Update existing records using the `UPDATE` statement.
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = new_value
WHERE condition;
```

3. Deleting Data: Remove specific records from a table with the `DELETE` statement.
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Database Design
1. Creating Tables: Use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to define the structure of a new table.
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
```

2. Modifying Tables: Alter existing tables using `ALTER TABLE` statement to add, modify, or drop columns.
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;

ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

### Exporting and Importing Data
1. Exporting Data: Right-click on a table, select "Table Data Export Wizard," and choose the desired export format (e.g., CSV, SQL).

2. Importing Data: Right-click on a table, select "Table Data Import Wizard," and follow the steps to import data from a file.

### Visual Database Design
1. Entity-Relationship Diagrams: Use the "Modeling" perspective to create Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams and visually design the database schema.

### Note: 
This guide provides an overview of essential MySQL Workbench features and syntax commonly used by data analysts. However, MySQL Workbench offers additional functionalities for database administration, stored procedures, and more. For further information, consult the MySQL Workbench documentation.

Here's the formatted text in Markdown:

## Task One
1. Create a database named `students_information`.
2. In the database you have created, create a table that has the following columns with the right data type:
   - `students_Id`
   - `first_name`
   - `last_name`
   - `Age`
   - `Exam_score`
   - `passing_grade` (A, B, C, D).
3. Populate the table for 10 students.

### Answer
```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE students_information;
USE students_information;

-- Create the students table
CREATE TABLE students (
    students_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Exam_score INT,
    passing_grade CHAR(1)
);

-- Insert data into the students table
INSERT INTO students (students_Id, first_name, last_name, Age, Exam_score, passing_grade) VALUES
    (1, 'Aang', 'Airbender', 112, 90, 'A'),
    (2, 'Katara', 'Waterbender', 15, 85, 'B'),
    (3, 'Sokka', 'Warrior', 16, 78, 'C'),
    (4, 'Toph', 'Beifong', 12, 92, 'A'),
    (5, 'Zuko', 'Firebender', 17, 88, 'B'),
    (6, 'Azula', 'Firebender', 14, 95, 'A'),
    (7, 'Iroh', 'Dragon', 60, 89, 'B'),
    (8, 'Suki', 'Kyoshi Warrior', 16, 87, 'B'),
    (9, 'Mai', 'Assassin', 17, 84, 'B'),
    (10, 'Ty Lee', 'Circus Performer', 16, 82, 'C');
```
